# Nemiel
I want to create a simple localhost Flask Python bootstrap table to list corporations with stocks that are listed in public stocks exchange with its book value. Learning how Lo Kheng Hong can make billions of IDR from Petrosea just by buying it when the price does not reflect its book value. I want to learn how to find undervalue corporations. Like Warren Buffett when you have to learn to be patience, and not buying anything when price are high on market. 

# How to Setup

I am using Conda inside Julia, but you can also use python directly to create virtual environment:
```
conda create -y -p /home/browni/.julia/conda/3/envs/nemiel

conda activate nemiel
(or)
conda activate /home/browni/.julia/conda/3/envs/nemiel

pip install -r /home/browni/.julia/conda/3/envs/nemiel/requirements.txt

```
